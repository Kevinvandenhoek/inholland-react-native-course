### Required items
‼️ Check off each item to get a 5.5 grade. Implement optional items to get a higher grade.

#### App functionality

- [ ] Working Expo Go project, should be able to scan the QR code and see the app running on any device.
- [ ] PokeAPI is used to fetch Pokémon data https://pokeapi.co/
  - [ ] List of Pokémon is loaded from the API.
  - [ ] Pokémon details (metadata, stats, evolution chain) are loaded from the API.
- [ ] List of Pokémon is displayed in a FlatList.
  - [ ] Must be able to filter the list by name using the search bar.
- [ ] Pokémon details are displayed in a ScrollView.
  - [ ] Must be able to navigate to the Pokémon details page from the list.
  - [ ] Must be able to favorite the Pokémon.
  - [ ] Must display type(s) for the Pokémon and use a unique color for each type.
  - [ ] Pokémon detail tabs, meta data, stats and evolution chain, should be swipeable left and right. (using [React Native TabView](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/main/packages/react-native-tab-view) for example)
- [ ] Favorites list is displayed in a FlatList.
  - [ ] Must be able to navigate to the Pokémon details page from the favorites list.
  - [ ] Must be able to unfavorite the Pokémon.
  - [ ] Empty state must be displayed when there are no favorites.
- [ ] Pokémon actions must include:
    - [ ] Favorite.
    - [ ] Share, use the [Share API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/share). You can share anything, Pokémon name, url to the Pokémon image.
    - [ ] Open in detail view.
- [ ] All async operations must include an loading and error state.
    - [ ] Fetching Pokémon list.
    - [ ] Fetching Pokémon details.
    - [ ] Fetching Pokémon evolution chain.

#### Project setup
- [ ] Tanstack Query for API calls.
- [ ] Expo Router for navigation.
- [ ] SQLite for local storage.
- [ ] Uses Typescript with no TS errors.
- [ ] Uses ESLint with no ESLint errors. (ideally use [React Compiler Linter](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/react-compiler/#enabling-the-linter))
- [ ] Uses Separation of Concerns (determine a project structure that follows this principle).
- [ ] [Expo Font](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/fonts/) is used to implement [the font](./assets/fonts.zip).


### Optional items
Each optional item is worth 1 extra point.

- [ ] Use of animations (e.g. loading in UI elements).
- [ ] Dark mode support (making use of theming).
- [ ] Pokémon [list is paginated](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/guides/infinite-queries), fetch 50 items at the time, and [infinite scroll](https://archive.reactnative.dev/docs/0.8/flatlist#onendreached) is used. Tip use infinite queries from Tanstack Query and the `onEndReached` prop from the FlatList component.
- [ ] Clean Typescript: no use of `any`, typecasting `as SomeType`, or TS ignore comments.
- [ ] Pixel Perfect Design on either iOS or Android.
- [ ] No bugs, console errors and use of console.log.
- [ ] Added [localizations](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/localization/) for the app.
- [ ] Adds Pokémon Battle Feature, this is worth a 💯 points!
